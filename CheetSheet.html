    <h1> World Wide Web </h1>
    The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.[10][11][12] He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN.

    <strong> What are the three essential technologies in the World Wide Web</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    The three Main technologies that made the World Wide Web are HTML, Urls, and HTTP.

    <br>
    Url is the addressing scheme to find a document.
    <br>
    HTTP which encodes and transportes information between a client and a Web Server.
    <br>
    HTML which allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links.

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong> Of what 5 componsents does the url consist
    </strong>

    <br>
    1.Schemes: Schemes are components followed by a colon (:), consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Popular schemes are http https malito and file.
    <br> <br>
    2.Authority: The authority component typically consists of both the domain name and, if applicable, the port number. It follows the scheme and the double slashes "//" and is part of the URL that identifies the server or hosting authority for the resource.
    <br> <br>
    3.Path: The path specifies the location and hierarchy of the resource on the server.
    <br> <br>
    4.Query: This part may contain query parameters for dynamic content retrieval and is usually preceded by a question mark "?."
    <br> <br>
    5.Fragment: The fragment identifies a specific section or location within the resource, typically preceded by a hash mark "#."
