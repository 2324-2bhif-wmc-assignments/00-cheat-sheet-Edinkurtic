            <h1> World Wide Web </h1>

            <strong> The Web was invented by English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN.[10][11][12] He was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization, as well as distributing them to collaborators outside CERN. </strong>
            <br>
            <br>

            <strong> What are the three essential technologies in the World Wide Web</strong>

            <p> The three Main technologies that made the World Wide Web are HTML, Urls, and HTTP. </p>

            <p>Url is the addressing scheme to find a document.</p>

            <p> HTTP which encodes and transportes information between a client and a Web Server. </p>

            <p> HTML which allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links. </p>

            <strong> Of what 5 componsents does the url consist </strong>



            <p> 1.Schemes: Schemes are components followed by a colon (:), consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or hyphen (-). Popular schemes are http https malito and file. </p>

            <p> 2.Authority: The authority component typically consists of both the domain name and, if applicable, the port number. It follows the scheme and the double slashes "//" and is part of the URL that identifies the server or hosting authority for the resource. </p>

            <p> 3.Path: The path specifies the location and hierarchy of the resource on the server. </p>

            <p> 4.Query: This part may contain query parameters for dynamic content retrieval and is usually preceded by a question mark "?." </p>

            <p> 5.Fragment: The fragment identifies a specific section or location within the resource, typically preceded by a hash mark "#." </p>

        <h1> Web Server</h1>


        <strong> What is a Web server?</strong>


        <p> A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP or its secure variant HTTPS. </p>

        <p> A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software.</p>

        <strong> What common features do Web Servers have?</strong>#

        <p> Static content serving: to be able to serve static content (web files) to clients via HTTP protocol.</p>

        <p> HTTP: support for one or more versions of HTTP protocol in order to send versions of HTTP responses compatible with versions of client HTTP requests, e.g. HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 (eventually also with encrypted connections HTTPS), plus, if available, HTTP/2, HTTP/3.</p>

        <p> Logging: usually web servers have also the capability of logging some information, about client requests and server responses, to log files for security and statistical purposes.</p>

        <h1> Web Client</h1>

        <strong> What is a Web Client</strong>

        <p> A web browser is an application for accessing websites.</p>

        <p> When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen.</p>

        <strong> What does a Web Client do</strong>

        <p> The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the World Wide Web or from local storage and display it on a user's device.</p>

        <p> He begins this process when the user types a URL into the browser.</p>

        <p> Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is clicked or tapped, the browser navigates to the new resource.</p>
